Tenderloin is a neighborhood in downtown San Francisco that encompasses about 50 square blocks. This neighborhood has historically resisted gentrification,  squalid conditions, homelessness, crime, and illegal drug trade giving the neighborhood a seedy reputation. 

We can observe from the bar chart from 2003 to 2018 that the number of drug crimes in the Tenderloin District was several times that of other areas, and even reached a peak of nearly 4,900 cases in 2008. However, this tide turns post-2009, where we can observe the line graph intercepts with a descending trend, which demonstrates a trend of this district trying to shake off its illicit drug trade.

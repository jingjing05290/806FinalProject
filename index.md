## Introduction
<div style="text-align: justify;">
San Francisco has been cataloging all reported crimes within its boundaries, creating a detailed database “Police Department Incident Reports” which encompasses crime categories, temporal, and geographic data since 2003. This extensive archive allows us to have a deep dive into the city's crime dynamics and intricate details of criminal activities. Through the dataset, we found that among all the neighborhoods in San Francisco, the Tenderloin district distinguishes itself with pronounced issues of substance abuse and drug-related crimes.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Our analysis shifts focus to the Tenderloin, specifically to compare its crime numbers—particularly related to drug crimes—with those in other challenged neighborhoods of the city.  Notably, our preliminary findings reveal a trend: despite its notoriety with drug crime in the past years, the Tenderloin has seen a consistent decline in drug crime rates over the years. This observation prompts us to delve deeper into this downward trend, seeking to uncover the factors and measures contributing to this decrease, to shed light on effective strategies for drug crime reduction across the Tenderloin neighborhood.

## Overall trend analysis
<div style="text-align: justify;">
From the above analysis graph, we can conclude that from 2003 to 2008, the number of drug crimes in the Tenderloin District was several times that of other areas and even reached a peak of nearly 4,900 cases in 2008, which clearly indicates that the Tenderloin is the epicenter of the city’s drug crisis in that period. However, this tide turned since 2010. The data shows that reports of drug crimes keeps falling in Tenderloin since 2010, with drug crimes recorded much fewer than they were one year ago, which demonstrates a trend of this district trying to shake off its illicit drug trade.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Why has there been a steady increase in earlier years and then followed by a decline in more recent times? One possible explanation could be changes in law enforcement strategies or urban renewal efforts. By adopting multiple analytical approaches to scrutinize the data  we aim to uncover the underlying factors that may explain why these trends have unfolded in the manner observed, thereby providing a more nuanced understanding of the complexities involved.

## Geographical distribution analysis

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The map above shows the  geographical distribution of drug crimes throughout the Tenderloin in 2008. In the map, three high rates of drug crimes areas' landmarks and street characteristics can be seen by interacting with the markers placed on the map. Upon our examination, we observe that drug crimes primarily cluster around certain locations such as parking lots, hotels, clubs, parks, and community centers—areas with high foot traffic and obstacles that can conceal criminal activities. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Specifically, the intersection of Turk Street and Taylor Street is originally hosted as a public parking lot and directly adjacent to a strip club. However, this parking lot was demolished to make way for the construction of modern apartments and then followed by a reduction in drug crime rates<a href="https://hoodline.com/2015/04/community-group-rallies-for-another-tenderloin-parking-removal/"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. Adiitionally, Law enforcement had implemented a strategy of prohibiting parking on both sides of streets in high-crime areas<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/nevius/article/banning-parking-on-tenderloin-block-drives-5208612.php/"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. These measure are effectively eliminate cars as potential cover for drug trading, which inadvertently highlights why parking lots have emerged as focal points for high drug crime rates. When we examine other places with higher drug crime rates such as hotels and community centers at two other markers on the map like place near the intersection of Ellis Street and Jones Street which holds many hotels and bars. The privacy and anonymity provided by these locations' hotels have become a haven for drug traders, attracting a large number of people seeking drugs and the dense population in community centers provides cover and markets for drug trade.

## Detailed trend analysis
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Although the heatmap provides a visual overview of regional distribution, it is hard to see a comparison of drug crime between different years and hours in a Tenderloin. The graph above are able to be clicked on a year to make its corresponding curve appear or disappear. Upon examining the hourly drug and narcotic crime data in the Tenderloin district from 2008 to 2012, we observed a distinct pattern of local drug crime activity. Specifically, from 2008 to 2009, the data shows a pronounced pattern of crime peaking twice within a day—once during midday from 11 AM to 2 PM and other peaks from 9 PM to 10 PM. The midday peak in these years far surpasses those of the subsequent years, highlighting the intense challenges Tenderloin faced during this period.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
However, Moving through the years towards 2012, there is a clear downward trend in the frequency of reported crimes, with the peak times shifting to later in the day. This suggests the possible impact of law enforcement's evolving strategies, which may include increased patrols during peak hours or crackdowns on known drug markets. Additionally, community intervention programs may have played a role in this decline, as local initiatives often aim to address the root causes of drug activity through outreach and support for at-risk populations.<a href="https://hoodline.com/2015/04/community-group-rallies-for-another-tenderloin-parking-removal/"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
</div>

## Conclusion
<div style="text-align: justify;">
In summary, the analysis demonstrates a notable decline in drug-related crimes in San Francisco's Tenderloin district, a significant shift from its peak in 2008. This trend suggests the effectiveness of targeted strategies, including law enforcement efforts and urban renewal initiatives.  Future research could delve into evaluating the impact of measures implemented by law enforcement, aiming to identify which interventions have been most effective in reducing drug crimes.

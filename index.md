Tenderloin is a neighborhood in downtown San Francisco that encompasses about 50 square blocks. The squalid conditions, homelessness, crime, and illegal drug trade giving this neighborhood a seedy reputation. Almost anyone who visits the area would not dispute its reputation: Substance abuse, poverty and human misery are out in the open.

How bad the Tenderloin was? And how does it compare to other “rough neighborhoods” in the city? Our exploration of these questions is anchored in a comprehensive analysis of the dataset-Police Department Incident Reports which spans from 2003 to 2018 and with a spotlight on the Tenderloin district's drug crimes reports.

From the above analysis graph based on the Police Department Incident Reports, we can conclude that from 2003 to 2018, the number of drug crimes in the Tenderloin District was several times that of other areas, and even reached a peak of nearly 4,900 cases in 2008, which clearly indicates that the Tenderloin is the epicenter of the city’s drug crisis in that period. However, this tide turned post-2009, and the data shows that reports of drug crimes are falling in Tenderloin since 2010, with drug crimes recorded much fewer than they were one year ago, which demonstrates a trend of this district trying to shake off its illicit drug trade.

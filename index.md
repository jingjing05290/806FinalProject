### Introduction
<div style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 10px;">
Tap water is an indispensable part of daily life for millions of its residents in New York City. Yet, this vital resource may carry a hidden threat to public health: lead contamination. Lead is a harmful metal that can have severe long-term effects on human health, even at trace levels. Studies have shown that exposure to lead not only profoundly affects the growth and development of children but also poses significant risks to adults, including increased blood pressure and problems with kidney and brain function. Crucially, even low levels can lead to health issues. Prolonged exposure to lead results in its accumulation in the body, and the longer the exposure, the more challenging it becomes for the body to eliminate the toxin. As most people with elevated blood lead levels do not look or feel sick, which can make lead poisoning hard to identify, This issue remains a significant public health concern.

San Francisco has been cataloging all reported crimes within its boundaries, creating a detailed database “Police Department Incident Reports” which encompasses crime categories, temporal, and geographic data since 2003. This extensive archive allows us to have a deep dive into the city's crime dynamics and intricate details of criminal activities. Through the dataset, we found that among all the neighborhoods in San Francisco, the Tenderloin district distinguishes itself with pronounced issues of substance abuse and drug-related crimes. 

Our analysis shifts focus to the Tenderloin, specifically to compare its crime numbers—particularly related to drug crimes—with those in other challenged neighborhoods of the city.  Notably, our preliminary findings reveal a trend: despite its notoriety with drug crime in the past years, the Tenderloin has seen a consistent decline in drug crime rates over the years. This observation prompts us to delve deeper into this downward trend, seeking to uncover the factors and measures contributing to this decrease, to shed light on effective strategies for drug crime reduction across the Tenderloin neighborhood.

From the above analysis graph, we can conclude that from 2003 to 2008, the number of drug crimes in the Tenderloin District was several times that of other areas and even reached a peak of nearly 4,900 cases in 2008, which clearly indicates that the Tenderloin is the epicenter of the city’s drug crisis in that period. However, this tide turned since 2010. The data shows that reports of drug crimes keeps falling in Tenderloin since 2010, with drug crimes recorded much fewer than they were one year ago, which demonstrates a trend of this district trying to shake off its illicit drug trade.

Through comprehensive analysis of the police station incident report dataset, with a particular focus on drug crime reports, we found that drug crimes are not only prevalent on every street but also that the majority of criminal activities are concentrated at intersections. Specifically, at the intersection of Ellis Street and Jones Street, as well as three hotels on Turk Street, drug trading activities are exceptionally frequent. The privacy and anonymity provided by these locations' hotels have become a haven for drug traders, attracting a large number of people seeking drugs. Meanwhile, a parking lot on Hyde Street also exhibits significant drug crime activity. This location, once adjacent to a strip club, was later transformed into luxury apartments. This change may signify an improvement in the area's security situation and reflects the potential impact of urban renewal on the management of drug crimes.

Upon examining the hourly drug and narcotic crime data in the Tenderloin district from 2008 to 2012, a pattern in local drug crime activity emerged. The data for 2008 was particularly striking, with crime activity peaking twice a day—once from 11 AM to 2 PM and again from 9 PM to 10 PM. The evening peak far exceeded those of other years, signifying the severe challenges Tenderloin faced that year. As the timeline progressed toward 2012, there was a significant decline in the number of crimes, with a shift to later in the day, suggesting that law enforcement strategies were taking effect, possibly aided by community intervention programs. This “tidal” effect of drug trading, syncing with the rhythm of city life and the cycle of day and night, revealed the hidden patterns of the drug market.


The Tenderloin district's transformation from 2003 to 2018 is a story of urban redemption, marked by a sharp decline in drug crimes from a 2008 peak. Analysis of drug-related incidents, particularly at key intersections and hotels, shows law enforcement and community interventions taking effect. By 2012, these efforts culminated in significantly reduced crime rates, signaling a turn towards safety and community rejuvenation, showcasing the impactful synergy of strategic policies and collective commitment to urban improvement.
